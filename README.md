## Functionality
- The app functions as a social platform for music discovery. Users can create posts about new music, comment on posts, follow other users, favorite songs, and search the database by genres or unique queries and more.

- The backend is developed with Spring Boot, MySql and the frontend uses Angular with Material components.

- The app utilizes Spring Security for user authentication, all passwords are hashed in the database.

- Upon logging in, users are redirected to the home page where they can view posts about the most recent music, they can favorite, read and add comments, listen to the song by clicking on the cards which opens the Post Details modal.

- The site navigation relies on the responsive sidebar. Users can conduct searches for posts, songs, genres and even other users. The Create Post button on the side bar allows users to create a new post. The sidebar also highlights filtering by Featured Genres and contains a link to the user's profile page.

- From the profile page, users can view their existing posts, comments, favorite songs, users they follow, and modify their profile through the settings page.

## Lessons Learned
###### Caleb K:

###### Gabriel A.:
Working on this team during this final sprint has taught me a lot about authentication and angular. I'm grateful to have been partnered with such insightful and driven individuals. The planning phase and communication really helped with mitigating potential issues that would appear later on. All that being said this was definitely a challenging project, particularly with the social aspect of the site and using angular to retrieve good data. Adding a following/followers feature was also challenging, and given the time frame I feel we did a great job implementing this feature. Taking the time to talk about design ideas and compromise as a team on certain decisions really helped us with getting a good final product.
###### Michael I:
I learned a lot using Angular and Spring Boot for this project to design a RESTful application. Using angular to add Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionality to our application made things a lot easier compared to having the backend handle everything. Adding youtube music players to our application was an interesting challenge that really paid off in the end. Planning ahead and really taking the time to map out what, how and why we are going to build different components was one of the biggest takeaways I learned from working as a group on this application.  
###### Ray S:
Angular and Spring frameworks work well together and we were able to cover all of our user stories with ease. These frameworks come with many quality of life addons that we successfully utilized. Things like Spring security, and Angular Material components reduced the amount of work we would normally have to put for a full-stack application at this scale. One of the key takeaways for me was the importance of keeping ourselves up to date with the with the changes in these types of frameworks.
